# Kirchhoffs-Theorem

This code finds the number of distinct spanning trees of a graph where vertices are distinct given its adjacency matrix. There are no safeguards in this code. Invalid inputs will output nonsense. Finding the number of spanning trees of a graph takes O(n^3) time. There are more details in the files themselves.
